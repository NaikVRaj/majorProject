## Problem Statement

Traditional methods of administering quizzes and exams in educational institutions lack efficiency and responsiveness, often characterized by manual processes and outdated assessment methods. Existing online quiz portals may not adequately address the needs of educational institutions, leading to challenges in exam management, assessment, and scalability. Furthermore, there is a growing demand for platforms that can accommodate user feedback and updates in a timely manner.

The project "QuizWhiz" aims to address these challenges by developing an online quiz portal tailored for educational institutions. The primary objective is to implement a typical DevOps pipeline to enhance frequent deliverables and responsiveness to user feedback. By leveraging DevOps methodologies, QuizWhiz seeks to streamline exam management processes, improve assessment methods, and ensure scalability and reliability. This initiative aims to revolutionize the assessment process in educational settings by providing a user-friendly and efficient platform for conducting quizzes and exams.
