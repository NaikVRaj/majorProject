## Problem Statement

In industrial settings, traditional methods of project management often lack efficiency and responsiveness, characterized by manual processes and disjointed workflows. Existing project management systems may not adequately address the needs of industrial projects, leading to challenges in project coordination, task assignment, and progress tracking. Additionally, there is a growing demand for platforms that can accommodate user feedback and updates in real-time.

The project "WorkWize" aims to address these challenges by developing a comprehensive project management platform tailored for industrial settings. The primary objective is to provide a streamlined and intuitive solution that enhances project workflows and facilitates effective project management by all stakeholders.
